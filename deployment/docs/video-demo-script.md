> Over the next 8 minutes, I'll show you the complete application - from the student learning experience to the teacher analytics dashboard, and then dive into the technical architecture that makes it all work.

> This isn't just a game - it's a comprehensive educational technology solution built with PHP, MySQL, and vanilla JavaScript, designed for production deployment and future integration with learning management systems like Drupal."

**Key Visual Elements:**
- Clean project structure
- Technology stack badges
- Brief architecture diagram

### Student Experience Demo (2.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Game interface - index.html]**

> "Let's start with the student experience. Notice the clean, intuitive design - this follows mobile-first responsive principles and accessibility guidelines."

**[Action: Start a new game session]**

> "When a student begins, they're presented with simple CVC words - that's consonant-vowel-consonant patterns like 'cat' and 'dog'. This follows scaffolded learning theory, starting within the learner's comfort zone."

**[Action: Demonstrate drag-and-drop]**

> "The drag-and-drop mechanics work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile. I've implemented this using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API with touch event fallbacks for mobile devices."

**[Action: Complete a word correctly]**

> "When students succeed, they get positive reinforcement - gentle animations, audio pronunciation using the Web Speech API, and progress visualization. Notice there's no harsh feedback for errors - this follows the Affective Filter Hypothesis from second language acquisition research."

**[Action: Show visual cues]**

> "Each word includes visual cues to support comprehension. This is crucial for EAL learners who benefit from multimodal input - combining visual, textual, and auditory learning channels."

**[Action: Demonstrate level progression]**

> "The system automatically adapts difficulty based on performance. If a student maintains 80% accuracy with good timing, they progress to more complex patterns. This implements the Zone of Proximal Development concept from educational psychology."

**[Action: Show mobile responsiveness]**

> "The interface is fully responsive - watch how it adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining usability. Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines, and the layout reflows intelligently."

### Teacher Dashboard Demo (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Teacher dashboard - teacher.html]**

> "Now let's look at the teacher dashboard - this is where the educational analytics really shine."

**[Action: Show session overview]**

> "Teachers can see all active student sessions at a glance - who's playing, when they last accessed the game, and their current progress level. This supports formative assessment practices."

**[Action: Click on individual student progress]**

> "Drilling down into individual students reveals detailed analytics. We track accuracy rates, time spent, error patterns, and learning progression over time."

**[Action: Show error pattern analysis]**

> "This error pattern analysis is based on EAL research. The system categorizes mistakes - vowel confusion, letter order issues, phonetic spelling attempts. This helps teachers identify specific areas where students need support."

**[Action: Demonstrate progress visualization]**

> "The progress charts show learning trajectories over time. Teachers can identify students who might be struggling or those ready for additional challenges."

**[Action: Show printable reports]**

> "Teachers can generate printable progress reports for parent-teacher conferences or administrative requirements. These include specific recommendations based on the student's learning patterns."

### Technical Architecture Deep Dive (2.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Code editor showing backend structure]**

> "Now let's examine the technical implementation. The backend uses modern PHP with a clean architecture approach."

**[Action: Show Database class]**

> "Here's the Database class - I'm using PDO with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Connection pooling and error handling are built in for production reliability."

**[Action: Show API structure]**

> "The API follows RESTful principles. Here's the progress endpoint - notice the input validation, error handling, and standardized response format."

**[Action: Show database schema]**

> "The database schema is optimized for educational analytics. The sessions table manages student sessions, progress tracks level-based advancement, and word_attempts captures granular data for error analysis."

**[Screen: Frontend JavaScript code]**

> "On the frontend, I've implemented a component-based architecture using vanilla JavaScript. Here's the main game class - it manages state, handles user interactions, and communicates with the API."

**[Action: Show drag-and-drop implementation]**

> "The drag-and-drop system handles both mouse and touch events. I've implemented visual feedback, collision detection, and smooth animations using CSS transforms for optimal performance."

**[Action: Show responsive CSS]**

> "The CSS uses modern techniques - CSS Grid for layout, custom properties for theming, and media queries for responsive behavior. Everything follows accessibility guidelines with proper focus management and ARIA labels."

---

### Production Features Demo (1.5 minutes)

**[Screen: Deployment documentation]**

> "This application is production-ready with comprehensive deployment documentation."

**[Action: Show security features]**

> "Security is built-in from the ground up - input validation, XSS protection, secure session management, and SQL injection prevention. I've included detailed security configuration guidelines."

**[Action: Show installation script]**

> "The automated installation script handles database setup, file permissions, and basic configuration. It includes system requirement checks and error handling."

**[Action: Show monitoring capabilities]**

> "For production deployment, I've included monitoring scripts, backup procedures, and performance optimization guidelines. The system is designed to handle hundreds of concurrent users."

**[Screen: Drupal integration documentation]**

> "Looking toward the future, I've designed this with Drupal integration in mind. The documentation includes complete integration strategies for Drupal 7 through 11, supporting both embedded modules and LTI integration."

---

### Educational Impact & Pedagogy (1 minute)

**[Screen: Requirements and design documents]**

> "What sets this project apart is the deep integration of educational theory with technical implementation."

**[Action: Show EAL-specific features]**

> "Every design decision is informed by second language acquisition research. The progressive difficulty system implements Krashen's Input Hypothesis. The error analysis follows Corder's Error Analysis framework. The positive feedback system addresses the Affective Filter Hypothesis."

**[Action: Show analytics dashboard]**

> "The analytics aren't just technical metrics - they're pedagogically meaningful data that help teachers make evidence-based instructional decisions."

> "This demonstrates understanding that educational technology isn't just about coding - it's about creating tools that genuinely support learning and teaching."

---

### Closing & Next Steps (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Project summary or future roadmap]**

> "This project showcases full-stack development skills, educational technology expertise, and production-ready implementation practices. The codebase is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and designed for scalability."

> "The application is ready for immediate deployment and designed for future enhancement - whether that's expanding the word database, adding new game modes, or integrating with existing learning management systems."

> "Thank you for your time. I'm excited to discuss how these skills and this educational technology perspective could contribute to your team's projects."
