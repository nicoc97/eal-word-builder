# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Word Builder is an interactive English vocabulary game designed to help EAL (English as an Additional Language) learners build foundational vocabulary through engaging, gamified experiences. The system consists of a PHP/MySQL backend for user management and progress tracking, and a JavaScript frontend providing interactive drag-and-drop gameplay. The application targets young EAL learners with progressive difficulty levels, visual cues, and immediate feedback to support language acquisition.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to play an interactive word-building game, so that I can learn English vocabulary in an engaging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the game THEN the system SHALL present a drag-and-drop interface for building words
2. WHEN a student drags letter tiles THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the drag operation
3. WHEN a student completes a word correctly THEN the system SHALL play audio pronunciation using Web Speech API
4. WHEN a student completes a word correctly THEN the system SHALL display positive visual feedback with animations
5. IF a student makes an error THEN the system SHALL provide gentle corrective feedback without penalty
6. WHEN a student completes a level THEN the system SHALL update their progress and unlock the next difficulty level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want the game to start with simple words and get progressively harder, so that I can build confidence and skills gradually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new student starts the game THEN the system SHALL begin with simple CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words like "cat", "dog", "pen"
2. WHEN a student demonstrates proficiency at their current level THEN the system SHALL automatically progress them to more complex words
3. WHEN displaying words THEN the system SHALL include visual cues with relevant images for each word
4. WHEN a student struggles with a difficulty level THEN the system SHALL provide additional practice at that level before progression
5. IF a student has been away from the game THEN the system SHALL resume at an appropriate difficulty level based on their last performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want my game progress to be saved, so that I can continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player completes a word THEN the system SHALL save their score to the database
2. WHEN a player returns to the game THEN the system SHALL load their previous progress and current level
3. WHEN a player advances to a new level THEN the system SHALL persist this progression
4. WHEN storing progress data THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and prevent data loss
5. IF a player hasn't played recently THEN the system SHALL maintain their saved progress

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player using a mobile device, I want the game to work well on my phone or tablet, so that I can learn anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player accesses the game on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch
2. WHEN a player drags letters on a touch device THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch feedback and smooth interactions
3. WHEN the game loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout while maintaining usability
4. WHEN a player rotates their device THEN the system SHALL adjust the interface appropriately
5. IF the internet connection is poor THEN the system SHALL still allow basic gameplay functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing this code, I want to see clean, well-documented code that demonstrates understanding of EAL pedagogy, so that I can assess technical and domain expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive comments explaining EAL learning principles
2. WHEN examining the database schema THEN the system SHALL demonstrate understanding of progress tracking for language learners
3. WHEN reviewing the API design THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful principles with clear endpoint documentation
4. WHEN assessing the frontend code THEN the system SHALL show modern JavaScript practices with clean, maintainable structure
5. WHEN evaluating the overall architecture THEN the system SHALL demonstrate scalability considerations for educational platforms
